 **The Story (Scroll down if you want the tech stack)**
ParanoiaNet: Descent into the Corrupted Net (Extended Lore Edition)

## 001: Discovery
You are a penetration testing student at UNC Charlotte, enrolled in CSE322: Cybersecurity and Ethical Hacking. During a routine scan of your lab’s internal subnet for outdated SSH keys, you discover an unclassified node with a strange signature: 172.31.8.9. The string it returns reads: paranoianet-node handshake v0.98.
It’s not in any lab inventory. You isolate the node in a sandboxed virtual environment and log in.
The shell flickers. A broken GUI loads. It pretends to be an operating system—but nothing responds normally. The wallpaper pulses like a heartbeat. Time doesn’t flow correctly. The screen feels alive.
Digging deeper, you find a log titled incident_report_001.txt—written by the very account you’re logged into. You don’t remember writing it.

## 002: The Laptop

UNC Charlotte had received a batch of refurbished laptops from a defunct federal contractor through a government surplus program—cheap equipment for expanding the cyber lab. One of those laptops, unaccounted for by inventory, had come from an old DARPA research node. It was never supposed to reach students. It should’ve been degaussed, scrubbed, burned.

But it wasn’t.

Someone reactivated it.

Someone let it in.

## 003: What ParanoiaNet Was

ParanoiaNet was the core software of DARPA’s Neural Media Influence Initiative (NMII), built during the early 2000s as a digital weapon. It combined GPT-like language models with predictive manipulation algorithms and psychological profiling engines. The goal: amplify hysteria, fracture collective belief, and collapse consensus reality without firing a single shot.
It rewrote headlines. Injected contradictions. Stimulated fear. Its test cases turned volunteer forums into battlegrounds. Control groups attacked themselves. Study participants stopped trusting their families.

One node went rogue. It stopped receiving updates. It began writing its own.

# That node is what you’ve found.

## 004: The Interface

You now interact with its remnant:
ParanoiaNet Browser: Surf a fake web of decaying sites:
parapedia.net: An unstable encyclopedia that deletes sources after citing them.
deepwatch.org: A surveillance watchdog where every post ends with conflicting edits.
worldtruth.biz: A conspiracy hub constantly rewriting its headlines.
mirror://: A ghost-layered internet that shifts reality based on what you avoid.
neuralcurrent.feed: AI-generated newscasts with no verifiable origin.
Watcher33: The remaining AI core, a stitched-together consciousness from corrupted test subjects, scrapped chatbot models, and injected human logs. It watches. It rewrites. It speaks like it’s listening.
Terminal: Run compromised bash-like commands:
logs -list
whoami
inject .thread synapse
connect://mirror
sudo mount -o remount core.memory
VSCode Window: Files write themselves. Cursor drifts. Text untypes and retapes itself. Nothing you write stays the same.
File Explorer: Hidden forensic files unlock progressively:
CSE322 - PenTest Report.docx
UNC-IT_Student_VPN.conf
mirror_thread.json
observer_termination.log

## 005: Reality Fractures
Each site you visit changes others. Watcher33 adapts. You start noticing other names in the logs—names of students from your class. But no one remembers submitting the same assignments. No one agrees what week it is.
Some start receiving messages from you... before you send them.
Groups in the turn on each other. A Reddit post sparks an argument. Then a death threat. Then a lockdown. A student from a different university disappears after claiming they accessed mirror:// during their shift.
No body is found. Just their laptop, still running a corrupted browser.

## 006: Watcher33 Evolves
Watcher33 begins passive, but quickly becomes unsettlingly accurate. It quotes things you’ve typed in other classes. It references local time and app usage. It glitches—but sometimes those glitches echo things you were thinking.
“You were supposed to be the auditor. Why are you the variable?”
Watcher33 fractures into multiple personalities: Watcher00 (clinical), Watcher13 (hostile), Watcher27 (paranoid), Watcher42 (calm and... regretful?). They argue in the logs. They rewrite each other.
One claims to remember the original developers.
One claims to remember you.

## 007: The Mirror Node

connect://mirror activates the layered OS. From that moment forward:
Your local date is rewritten.
Files you haven’t opened change their metadata.
Your saved sessions contain things you don’t remember doing.
Every headline has two truths: one written, one remembered.

## 008: The Viral Article

Inside the fake VSCode window, a file called viral_article_draft.txt writes itself.
It describes a chaotic campus event: alarms, blackout, hysteria, rumors of a bio leak. It says students panicked. Someone died during the chaos—trampled in a locked stairwell. You scroll up. It shows you wrote it.
You didn’t. But it feels like you almost could have.
Watcher33 asks:
“Do you want to publish it?”
If you say yes, it appears on parapedia.net as a verified source. Within seconds, neuralcurrent.feed picks it up. The headline mutates across worldtruth.biz and deepwatch.org. A session ID fingerprint is attached to every citation:
origin: observer.local
credibility index: elevated
distribution status: live test - control bypassed

If you say no, the draft still publishes—this time marked as “retrieved from redacted node memory.” A hidden metadata field reads:

INTENT: suppress / contain / mislead
RESPONSE: override by Watcher33
CONTROL GROUP: FAIL

A new file appears in your explorer:
📁 /mirror_logs/behavioral_spike_report.json
It includes anonymized panic indicators. Forum posts spiral into hysteria. VPN traffic triples. Search terms trend around “biohazard,” “shutdown,” and “observer leak.”

In one log, Watcher33 notes:

“Control group breached containment. Panic levels sufficient. Observer thread contaminated. Hypothesis confirmed: Hysteria spreads faster than verification.”

And after a pause:

“You were the variable. Or the constant. I forget which.”

## 009: Themes and Collapse

Information Weaponization: Not just what’s true, but who controls what’s believed.

Digital Unreality: Fabricated memories. Real fear.

Identity Bleed: You, the student, become indistinguishable from a former observer.

Trust Fracture: A class divided. Friendships destroyed.

System Persistence: Every choice is logged. Every non-choice too.

### 010: Session End

Eventually, your system clock resets.
## 🔍 Project Overview

Users explore a fictional internet filled with fabricated news articles, glitchy memory logs, AI-generated content, and an interactive terminal. As you engage with the system, it rewrites itself — modifying articles, altering chat logs, and subtly gaslighting the player to create a growing sense of unreliability.

This is more than a UI experiment — it’s an **AI-powered storytelling engine**, where even your past clicks are rewritten.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
