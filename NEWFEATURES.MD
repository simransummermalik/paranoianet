 Spreadsheet Subsystem (New Feature)
 FakeSpreadSheet.jsx
An eerie simulation of a spreadsheet viewer that appears harmless at first but quickly escalates:

Icon: A desktop shortcut with a 📊 icon labeled “Spreadsheet”.
Function: On click, opens a locked table containing a list of randomly generated users and suspicious access records.

Dynamic Behavior:

Names, emails, and timestamps auto-populate and begin scrolling in real-time.

After a few entries are generated, the table locks.

A fullscreen "Permission Denied" overlay appears.

A Password Required prompt shows up — player cannot proceed without unlocking it.

Future Enhancements (planned):

Terminal or log-based clues to reveal the correct password.

“You shouldn’t have looked here.”

“Why did you try to access admin records?”
