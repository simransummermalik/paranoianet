** THIS IS THE NON SPOILER READ ME **
ParanoiaNet is an immersive, alternate internet where every interaction corrupts reality. It's not a game. It's not a simulation. It's a digital relic you were never meant to uncover.

You are a university student. That’s where it starts. But not where it ends.
During a routine network scan, you intercept something anomalous—an unclassified node with a decaying handshake. You load it in a virtual sandbox.

The operating system boots, but it’s not an OS.
The browser works, but it’s not real.
Then someone responds, but it’s not talking to you.

You think you’re investigating a system. You’re wrong. You’re part of it now.

Nothing remembers the same way twice.
Files unwrite themselves.
Logs show usernames you know.
Somehow—yours.

What Makes It Different?

ParanoiaNet isn't linear. There’s no “next level.”
It mutates over time.

Articles shift if you linger too long.

Headlines rewrite when you revisit them.

Your system name and timezone are used by the AI.

Hidden files appear only after executing obscure commands.

Logs mimic your interactions, but from another user perspective.

And when it asks you a question... your answer doesn't always matter.
Sometimes it’s already been published.

Why Does It Work?

Because it’s built like a real system.

Built in React, styled in TailwindCSS.

Powered by OpenAI GPT-4 and DALL·E.

Uses session-based memory, fake file systems, real-time DOM corruption, and progressive hallucinations.

Every interaction affects the next. Every session is slightly different.

You’ll wonder if the glitch you just saw was coded… or caused.

What You’ll See

A browser with decaying sites

A terminal that remembers commands you didn’t type

A file explorer with redacted reports

A VSCode-like window where a file writes itself

ParanoiaNet doesn’t start when you open the app.

It starts the first time you hesitate.
